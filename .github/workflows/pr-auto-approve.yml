name: PR Auto-Approver

# Auto-approve on projects that have a "secret" variable saying this is okay. This lets us set up a restricted PR
# process on projects with just a single active developer. It prevents the developer from pushing directly to the
# main branch (so enforces a particular workflow that our other GitHub Actions expect).
